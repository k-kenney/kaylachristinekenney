        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="/assets/kenney-kayla-photo-39f49d4c.jpg" alt="Picture of Kayla">
        <p>Hi there! My name is Kayla. I am a frontend web developer that travels the world. I love designing and creating websites and apps make businesses more accessible for others. I am a creative at heart and like to design beautiful websites from scratch.</p>
        <p>With a background in international education, I understand the importance of life-long learning. I am a well-rounded individual that loves meeting new people, exploring different cultures and trying new things - especially food!</p>
        <p>While teaching fourth grade in Armenia to a small group of students, I had to wear many hats. One of which was technology teacher. This baffled me and quite honestly, I was scared. At that time, my students knew more than I did about technology. </p>
        <p>After taking the plunge and sorting out what I needed to teach my students, I came across Scratch. Admittedly, the program blew my mind! After that, there was no turning back. I had to learn more about how coding worked. </p>
        <p>I began by learning CSS and HTML through Udemy courses. Eventually, I needed more and began at Skillcrush, an online learning platform for frontend developers. Skillcrush awakened my senses to how in depth programming could be which led to me enrolling in the Le Wagaon online web development bootcamp.</p>
        <p>Throughout my web development journey, I have learned about CSS3, HTML5, Git, Github, JavaScript, React, Ruby, SQL, APIs, Ruby on Rails and more. The teacher in me understands the importance of learning and the explorer in me continues to challenge herself every step of the way.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm working on personal projects and for people who are in need of a gorgeous, glossy wesbites while traveling around the world with my husband and two cats.</p>
        <p>When I’m not coding, you can find me hiking, doing yoga, playing ukulele or testing out a new recipe!</p>
